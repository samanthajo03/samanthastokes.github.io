    <p>There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. Nice! Come on! It's them! Blast them! Get back to the ship! Where are you going? Come back! He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock! That oughta hold it for a while. Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. Oh, I think I just blasted it. They're coming through! Here, hold this. Here they come! For luck!
